# dungeoncrawler
Dungeon Crawler is a game I developed when I was in college that took a lot of it's inspiration from old hack-n-slash RPG's and games like Diablo and NetHack. This was a labor of love for me when I was still learning how to program. It was developed in C++ and MFC, and I had a blast developing it. Some day I'll go back and make a real version of this game - simple and straightforward and a ton of fun to develop and play!

Built in 2002/2003 in MS Visual C++ 6.0.
